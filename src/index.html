	  </div>

	  <div class="span4">
	    <h2>Browsers Are Bad at Bookmarks</h2>
	    <p>
	      They can't search.  You have to organise them yourself if you
	      want to be able to find anything later.  Browsers save bookmarks
	      to the hard drive of the computer you're on.  If you want to see
	      them on another computer later (say if you go home for the day)
	      you're out of luck.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      And the more bookmarks you have, the harder they are to keep
	      organised.  Finding that bookmark from earlier means looking
	      through the browser menus for the title you saved it under.
	      Maybe you even start deleting bookmarks because you have so many
	      that organising them is unmanageable.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Most people have given up on using bookmarks.  It's too hard.
	      Too fiddly.  Too annoying.  But it doesn't have to be this way.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="span4">
	    <h2>All Together</h2>
	    <p>
	      With web browsers, bookmarks often get split up between different
	      computers.  This becomes a pain when you want to look though the
	      bookmarks you made at work when you're in bed with your iPad.  It
	      also makes it harder to organise.  Did I save a copy of this
	      already on another machine?  Are my bookmarks all in sync?
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Recall keeps everything together.  All of your bookmarks are
	      stored in the same pool.  You can search through everything you
	      have no matter where you are.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Your existing bookmarks can be imported into Recall.  We accept
	      the "Netscape" bookmark file format, which every major browser
	      can export into.  And if you're using something unusual, get in
	      touch and we'll import it as a special job.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="span4">
	    <h2>Never Lose Bookmarks Again</h2>
	    <p>
	      Losing data, of any kind, is extremely frustrating.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Your bookmarks are incredibly personal.  They represent months,
	      possibly years of reading and research.  How would you feel if
	      you lost them?
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Most people do no backups whatsoever.  Of the few who do, it's
	      doubtful that they remember to backup their bookmarks, which are
	      kept inside the browser's program files, not with the rest of the
	      important documents.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <strong>Recall will handle the backups for you</strong>.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
	  <div class="span4">
	    <h2>Search Is Great</h2>
	    <p>
	      Remember when the first search engines became popular?  Suddenly, the
	      web got a lot more useful.  Recall is a search engine.  It's a bit
	      different though &ndash; it's designed to work with bookmarks.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Every time you add a bookmark to Recall, it looks at the web
	      page's text.  This text is added to a "search index".  Later,
	      when you want to find things again you can do keyword search,
	      just like you can on Google.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <strong>Searching makes it much easier to find things.</strong>
	      Often, a search will turn up results you had forgotten about or
	      didn't remember were related.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      You don't have to bother with doing all the organisation by hand.
	      Just add bookmarks to Recall and then search later.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="span4">
	    <h2>We Don't Sell Your Details</h2>
	    <p>
	      Recall is a purely subscription product.  We charge money!  This
	      makes us a bit different from traditional "dot-com" businesses.
	      They let anyone sign up for free but then make their money by
	      selling adverts and customer data on to marketers.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Recall has proper privacy, not confusing "permissions".  When you
	      save a bookmark into Recall you can mark it as private.  If it's
	      private, no one else can see it.  It's as simple as that.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      We care about your privacy in other ways too.  Recall asks for
	      real names by default, but it doesn't insist.  You can use a made
	      up pseudonym instead, though you probably have to give your real
	      name to Paypal.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="span4">
	    <h2>No Crafty Adverts</h2>
	    <p>
	      Other search engines' results pages are one part results and two
	      parts paid advertisement.  We don't take money from marketers, so
	      our search results are always real results.  They're never crafty
	      adverts designed to look like search results.

	    <h2>Using Recall Is Easy</h2>
	    <p>
	      <strong>Recall could not be more straightforward to use</strong>.
	      Bookmarks are saved with our special browser buttons:
	      "bookmarklets" for most browsers and a Google Chrome extension.
	      Adding Recall to your browser is a snap.

	    <h2>We Guarantee You'll Like It</h2>
	    <p>
	      We care a lot about our customers.  We have every incentive to
	      care, because unlike a lot of big technology companies, it's our
	      customers who pay us.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Recall, like most software, is constantly being improved.  We
	      have a long term plan of new features and we'll decide what to do
	      based on what our customers tell us.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      We really hope that you like it.  But if you don't we'll refund
	      your money <strong>any time for six months after you

        <h2>Step 1: Import your existing bookmarks (if you have any)</h2>
	<p>
	  Any web browser and most social bookmarking services will
	  allow you to export your bookmarks as an HTML file (sometimes
	  this is called "Netscape Navigator" format).  You can import
	  this file format into Recall here:
	<p>
          <form action="#" class="form-vertical">
            <input id="m-i-bookmarks-file-input" type="file"/>
	    <br/>
            <button id="m-i-import" class="btn btn-primary"
                    type="submit">Import</button>
          </form>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Please allow 24 hours for all of your imported bookmarks to appear in
	  the search engine.  In normal use of Recall, bookmarks take only a
	  few seconds to appear.
	</p>

	<h2>Step 2: Install either the extension or the bookmarklet</h2>
	<h3>On Google Chrome</h3>
	<p>
	  You can install the extension for your web browser from the Chrome
	  Web Store
	  <a alt="Download the extension from the Chrome Web Store"
	     href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recall/jcbfhaedomkmfcmjmophmglklealobio">
	    here</a>
	</p>
	<h3>On Mozilla Firefox</h3>
	<p>
	  Drag the bookmarklet onto your bookmarks toolbar.  There is also a quick video
	  showing <a href="/bookmarklet.webm">how to do this</a>
	  (<a href="/bookmarklet.mp4">in two formats</a>).
	</p>
	<p id="bookmarklet-p">
	  <a class="bookmarklet btn btn-inverse" id="bookmarklet-a" href="#"
	     >bookmark this</a>
	</p>
	<p>
	  If you're using Mozilla Firefox and you don't see your bookmarks
	  toolbar you can unhide it in by going to the "View" menu, going the
	  "Toolbars" submenu and clicking on "Bookmarks Toolbar".
	</p>
	<h2>Step 3: Bookmark some pages</h2>
	<p>
	  Whenever you visit a page that you want to save, use the bookmarklet
	  or the Google Chrome extension to save it to Recall.  It will be
	  added to the search engine automatically.
