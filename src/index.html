	    <!-- First Line/Interest -->
	    <p>
	      Remember before the first search engines?  The web was a bit of a
	      nightmare.  Poorly organised.  Hard to browse.  Difficult to find
	      things.
	    </p>
	    <!-- Drama/Simple Expl -->
	    <p>
	      Search engines made finding new pages on the web a lot better.
	      Some things haven't changed though.  Bookmarks are still the way
	      they were in the mid-nineties.  You still organise them by hand.
	      If you have a lot then you have a lot of organising.
	    </p>
	    <!-- Why it's different -->
	    <p>
	      Recall is a search engine for your bookmarks.  You save bookmarks
	      to it and then you can search through them.  Unlike bookmarks in
	      a web browser, you don't have to keep things meticulously
	      organised.  And the search is based on the body text of a link,
	      not just the title or the url.  If you have a lot of bookmarks,
	      like I do, it's a real improvement.  I don't bother filing
	      bookmarks into sub-subfolders or making sure I give them all
	      meaningful names.  I just bung it all in and then search for what
	      I want.  Much easier.
	    </p>
	    <!-- How to use -->
	    <p>
	      It really is dead simple.  You just drag and drop a button into
	      your web browser and then you're ready to go.  Use the button to
	      bookmark pages on the web as you browse.  It'll pop up a dialog box
	      confirming things and then you click save.  After you've added a
	      page, Recall goes and downloads it, analyses it and saves the
	      analysis to its "search index" ready for you to search for it
	      later.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
	  <div class="offset4 span4">
	    <figure style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em">
	      <img src="/popup.png">
	      <figcaption>Bookmarks saved into Recall can be searched by the
	      full text of the page, not just by the title</figcaption>
	  </div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
	  <div class="offset2 span8">
	    <p>
	      The important part is that the whole body text from the page is
	      indexed.  It doesn't just use the title of the page - using all
	      the text makes searching a lot better.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      When you search, Recall looks through the whole body text of every
	      page you've ever bookmarked and shows you the relevant ones.
	      That way, if you have a bunch of bookmarks on gardening, you can
	      just search for "gardening" and it'll show them all.  Personally,
	      I have the Recall search page set as my home page in my browser -
	      it's the page I use the most.

	    <!-- Unique Features -->
	    <p>
	      I think everyone has been annoyed by a bad site search engine.
	      My local library's search engine drives me round the bend.  The
	      search is slow and then when things appear they're basically
	      irrelevant.  Recall is different.  It's built on top of the
	      Lucene text search library.  This is the same text search library
	      used by Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter.  It's state of the art.
	    </p>
	    <!-- Answer objections: Price -->
	    <p>
	      Recall is a subscription product - there is an annual fee.  This
	      makes it a little different from traditional "dot-com" web apps.
	      They let anyone sign up for free.  Then they make their money by
	      selling customer data to advertisers.  Sometimes the adverts are
	      so crafty, it's hard to tell what's real and what's an advert.  I
	      don't want to be doing that, so I charge the annual fee.  It
	      means I don't have to sell my soul (or yours!) to marketers.
	    </p>
	    <!-- Answer objections: Existing Bookmarks -->	    
	    <p>
	      Probably, you already have some bookmarks saved.  They can be
	      imported.  Recall supports something called the "Netscape
	      Navigator" bookmark file format.  It's as old as the hills and
	      every web browser is able to export to it.  If you have different
	      bookmarks saved on different computers, you can import them all.
	      It takes about a minute.
	    </p>
	    <!-- Guarantee -->
	    <p>
	      If you're ever unhappy with Recall I'll refund a your entire
	      year's subscription.  You don't even have to tell me why.
	    </p>
	    <!-- Any questions -->
	    <p>
	      This is just a quick note to tell you about Recall.  If you're
	      thinking of subscribing but have questions, email me
	      at <a href="mailto:cal@calpaterson.com">cal@calpaterson.com</a>.
	      I'll be happy to explain, or give you a test account.

        <h2>Step 1: Import your existing bookmarks (if you have any)</h2>
	<p>
	  Any web browser and most social bookmarking services will
	  allow you to export your bookmarks as an HTML file (sometimes
	  this is called "Netscape Navigator" format).  You can import
	  this file format into Recall here:
	<p>
          <form action="#" class="form-vertical">
            <input id="m-i-bookmarks-file-input" type="file"/>
	    <br/>
            <button id="m-i-import" class="btn btn-primary"
                    type="submit">Import</button>
          </form>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Please allow 24 hours for all of your imported bookmarks to appear in
	  the search engine.  In normal use of Recall, bookmarks take only a
	  few seconds to appear.
	</p>

	<h2>Step 2: Install either the extension or the bookmarklet</h2>
	<h3>On Google Chrome</h3>
	<p>
	  You can install the extension for your web browser from the Chrome
	  Web Store
	  <a alt="Download the extension from the Chrome Web Store"
	     href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recall/jcbfhaedomkmfcmjmophmglklealobio">
	    here</a>
	</p>
	<h3>On Mozilla Firefox</h3>
	<p>
	  Drag the bookmarklet onto your bookmarks toolbar.  There is also a quick video
	  showing <a href="/bookmarklet.webm">how to do this</a>
	  (<a href="/bookmarklet.mp4">in two formats</a>).
	</p>
	<p id="bookmarklet-p">
	  <a class="bookmarklet btn btn-inverse" id="bookmarklet-a" href="#"
	     >bookmark this</a>
	</p>
	<p>
	  If you're using Mozilla Firefox and you don't see your bookmarks
	  toolbar you can unhide it in by going to the "View" menu, going the
	  "Toolbars" submenu and clicking on "Bookmarks Toolbar".
	</p>
	<h2>Step 3: Bookmark some pages</h2>
	<p>
	  Whenever you visit a page that you want to save, use the bookmarklet
	  or the Google Chrome extension to save it to Recall.  It will be
	  added to the search engine automatically.
