	    <h2>Browsers Aren't Great</h2>
	    <p>
	      <strong>Browsers make bookmarks hard.</strong>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      They can't search through your bookmarks.  You have to organise
	      them around themes yourself if you want to be able to find
	      anything later.  Browsers save bookmarks to the hard drive of the
	      computer you're on.  If you want to see them on another computer
	      later (say if you go home for the day) you're out of luck.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The more bookmarks you have, the harder they are to use.  Finding
	      that bookmark from earlier involves having to look through the
	      browser menus for the title you saved it under.  You start having
	      to delete bookmarks because you have so many that it's become
	      unmanagable.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Most people have basically given up on using bookmarks.  It's too
	      hard.  Too fiddly.  Too annoying.  But it doesn't have to be this
	      way.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="span4">
	    <h2>Search is Great</h2>
	    <p>
	      Remember when the search engines became popular?  Suddenly, the
	      web became useful.  Recall is a search engine.  It's a bit
	      different through &mdash; it's designed to work with bookmarks.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Every time you add a bookmark to Recall, it looks at the web
	      page's text.  This text is added to a "search index".  Later,
	      when you want to find things again you can do keywords search,
	      just like Google.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <strong>Searching makes it much easier to find things.</strong>
	      Often, a search will turn up results you had forgotten about or
	      didn't remember were on the same subject.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      It's also means that there's a lot less effort in trying to
	      classify and organise things by hand.  A lot of time and effort
	      is saved.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="span4">
	    <h2>Using Recall is Easy</h2>
	    <p>
	      <strong>Recall could not be more straightforward to use</strong>.
	      Bookmarks are saved with our special browser buttons &mdash;
	      "bookmarklets" for most browsers and a Google Chrome extension.
	      Adding Recall to your browser is a snap.

	    <h2>We Don't Sell Your Details</h2>
	    <p>
	      Recall is a purely subscription product.  We charge money for our
	      product.  This makes us a bit different from traditional
	      "dot-com" businesses.  They let anyone sign up for free and make
	      their money by selling their "customers"' data and adverts to
	      marketers.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Recall has proper privacy, not confusing "permissions".  When you
	      save a bookmark into Recall you can mark it as private.  If it's
	      private, it won't appear to anyone else.  It's as simple as that.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      We care about your privacy in other ways too.  Recall asks for
	      real names by default, but it doesn't insist.  You can sign up
	      with a pseudonym (though you probably have to give your real name
	      to Paypal).  In the future, we'll look at increasing this kind of
	      pseudonym.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="span4">
	    <h2>Never Lose Bookmarks Again</h2>
	    <p>
	      Losing data, of any kind, is extremely frustrating.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Your bookmarks are incredibly personal.  They represent months,
	      possibly years of reading and research.  How would you feel if
	      you lost them?
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Most people do no backups whatsoever.  Of the few who do, it's
	      doubtful that they rememeber to backup their bookmarks, which are
	      kept inside the browser's program files, not with the rest of the
	      important documents.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <strong>Recall will handle the backups for you</strong>.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="span4">
	    <h2>All Together</h2>
	    <p>
	      With web browser bookmarks, often, bookmarks get split up between
	      different computers.  This becomes a pain, for example, when you
	      want to look though the bookmarks you made at work when you're in
	      bed with your iPad.  It also makes it harder to organise.  Did I
	      save a copy of this already on another machine?
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Recall keeps everything together.  All of your bookmarks are
	      stored in the same pool.  So you can search through everything
	      you have no matter where you are.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Your existing bookmarks can be imported into Recall.  We accept
	      the "Netscape" bookmark file format, which every major browser
	      can export into.  And if you're using something unusual, get in
	      touch and we'll import it as a special job.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
	  <div class="span4">
	    <h2>No Crafty Adverts</h2>
	    <p>
	      Other search engines' "results" pages are one part results and two
	      parts paid advertisement.  We don't take money from marketers.
	      Our search results are always real results &mdash; and never
	      crafty adverts designed to look like search results.

	  <div class="span4">
	    <h2>We Guarantee You'll Like It</h2>
	    <p>
	      We care a lot about our customers.  We have every incentive to
	      care, because unlike a lot of big technology companies, it's our
	      customers who pay us.  As we've said, we don't sell our customers
	      to advertisers.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Recall, like most software, is not "done".  We're going to keep
	      adding improvements and new features and we're going to survey
	      our customers to find out which direction they'd like things to
	      move it.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      We really hope that you like it.  But if you don't we'll refund
	      your money <strong>any time for six months after you
	      subscribe</strong>.

	  Any web browser and most social bookmarking services will
	  allow you to export your bookmarks as an HTML file (sometimes
	  this is called "Netscape Navigator" format).  You can import
	  this file format into Recall here:
          <form class="form-vertical">

      <div class="row">
        <div class="span12">
	  <h3>Step 2: Install extension or bookmarklet</h3>
